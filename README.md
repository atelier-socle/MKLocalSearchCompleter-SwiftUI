# MKLocalSearchCompleter-SwiftUI

MKLocalSearchCompleter-SwiftUI repository has been made to see how integrate `MKLocalSearchCompleter` using SwiftUI. The sample app is doing it's job: fetching addresses from `MKLocalSearchCompleter` then display them in a list.

This repository is not usable as a framework, but you may find some code to reuse in your own project :)
